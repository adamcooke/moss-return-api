#Â HMRC MOSS Return API

This service allows you to easily convert JSON into an HMRC-compatible ODS file
which can be uploaded to them when submitting your MOSS (mini one stop shop)
returns every quarter.

You can use this API at [mossreturn.uk](https://mossreturn.uk).

This is powered by my [HMRC MOSS Return library](https://github.com/adamcooke/hmrc-moss-return)
which allows you to easily construct HMRC ODS files.
